## Projects
### University of Petra ([UOP](https://www.uop.edu.jo/Ar/Pages/default.aspx#)) Systems
As a Developer at the University of Petra, I worked on several key systems, including the instructor profile system, placement test system, transportation system, embassy system, and various other systems. I was involved in all phases of the software development lifecycle, from requirements gathering and system design to development, testing, and deployment. My responsibilities included developing user-friendly interfaces, optimizing system performance, and ensuring robust security measures. I collaborated closely with cross-functional teams to deliver tailored solutions that met the specific needs of the university. My contributions significantly enhanced the efficiency and effectiveness of university operations, providing reliable and scalable software solutions.

### [Acorna (https://acornasolutions.com/) ERP System] 
As a Developer on the Acorna ERP System project, I played a key role in developing and implementing a comprehensive enterprise resource planning solution. I contributed to integrating essential business functions such as finance, human resources, inventory management, sales, procurement, and CRM into a single, unified system. I developed and optimized algorithms for real-time data analytics, significantly enhancing decision-making capabilities. Additionally, I designed a user-friendly interface to facilitate seamless adoption across various departments and ensured the system's scalability and customization to meet diverse industry requirements. I implemented robust security measures to protect sensitive business data and collaborated closely with cross-functional teams to gather requirements and deliver tailored solutions. I conducted thorough testing and provided support during deployment, achieving significant improvements in operational efficiency and productivity for client businesses.
